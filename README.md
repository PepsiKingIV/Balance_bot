# Balance_bot
Recently, I got the idea to keep expenses and income. There are some good apps in the Play market, but they have common drawbacks:
1. Most of them are paid.
2. They don't have an application on the computer.
3. I don't want to produce apps on my phone.
4. The creator wanted to write some interesting project for him, integrate a database into the service.
So I decided to make my bot in telegram.
